        We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br />
        And in spring too I feel no different.<br />
        We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br />
        through much dark-red loss, appellation controlée,<br />
        <br />
        that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br />
        We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br />
        Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br />
        sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br />
        <br />
        33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br />
        of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br />
        at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br />
        <br />
        Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br />
        The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br />
        The here is nowhere, and the now is never.<br />
