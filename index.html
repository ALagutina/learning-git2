    <h1>Taarlo</h1>
    We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br />
    And in spring too I feel no different.<br />
    We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br />
    through much dark-red loss, appellation controlée,<br />
    <br />
    that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br />
    We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br />
    Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br />
    sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br />

    33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br />
    of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br />
    at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br />
    <br />
    Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br />
    The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br />
    The here is nowhere, and the now is never.<br />
    <br />
